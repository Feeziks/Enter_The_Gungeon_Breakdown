Length of a "tile" side roughly ~320 ish pixels? maybe a 400 x 400 tile 

lots of hard black borders to make it easy to tell where a wall ends / door starts / enemy model is

Several shades of colors in the wall for shadow effects, repeating patter above bricks for an outline

maybe 4 or 5 colors in the pallete in floor 1

Torches provide nice "glow" effect around them

some non-interactables on the walls and floors to add some pop

colors are more muted, makes player enemies and interactables stand out

UI and mini-map use bright contrasting colors to be readable

view is NOT directly top down, the wall tiles at the top are very different from the ones at the bottom of the room
	Top wall is roughly 130 pixels tall ~1/3rd length of a slot?
		If we assume a 45 degree viewing angle what portion of the wall is viewable?
	top you see the entire wall, bottom is just the "top" of the wall
	as for the sides/walls in middle, treat these as a top down view, our view point is locked in on the x axis, rotated slightly about the z

right angles for vast majority of scenery

dont be afraid to put impassible terrain in the middle of a room

rooms in general seem to be "medium" sized. Maybe translates to around 4 x 5? slots
	For our algo size of room currently increases with level and difficulty
		Pros: Game gets harder w/o artificial bullet sponge, more map for player to explore, higher chance of random shrine/loot etc
		Cons: Game can become tedious, "punishes" good players(?), slows down the desired fast pace gameplay loop

	Perhaps strike a balance. Rooms will very slowly increase in size, but the maps will become larger quickly? Each individual room is fast paced
	but the game still increases difficulty by throwing more enemies and a harder maze at you. Still offers increase chance of loot and random spawns
	because more total rooms generated.

"out of bounds" area is just flat color, no distractions
